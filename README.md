# Algorithm_HW4_box_problem
Learn how to implement topological sort to find the longest route of DAG.<br>
We need to find out that the most amounts of boxes we can package. (Bigger box can contain smaller box.)

## How to use
```bash
$ python Box.py
```
## Input type
```py
9
483 442 486
469 259 224
134 424 237
112 494 391
394 131 7
100 100 100
200 200 200
300 300 300
400 400 400
# First line give an integer N that means how many boxes there are.
# In the following N lines, each give the length, width and height of box.
```
## Output type
```py
5
# It means that the maximum amounts of boxes.
```
